# Server Architecture Design Document for Healthcare Data Management System (MVP)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
This document presents the design of a minimal viable product (MVP) for a healthcare data management system. It focuses on a simplified two-tier server architecture, suitable for initial deployment and testing.

### Scope
This MVP includes a HAPI-FHIR RESTful server for business logic and a HAPI FHIR JPA Server for data persistence, deployed within an AWS environment.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

### Architectural Diagram
The architecture involves:
- **Tier 1**: HAPI-FHIR RESTful Server
- **Tier 2**: HAPI FHIR JPA Persistence Server

### Tier 1 - RESTful Server (HAPI-FHIR)
- **Functionality**: Handles business logic for FHIR resources.
- **Supported Resources**: Manages various FHIR resources.
- **Technology Stack**: HAPI-FHIR library with Java Spring Framework.

### Tier 2 - Persistence Server (HAPI FHIR JPA Server)
- **Database Integration**: Linked to an external RDS database.
- **Data Management**: Manages CRUD operations on FHIR resources.
- **Technology Stack**: HAPI FHIR JPA server.

## 3. AWS Environment

### AWS Components
- **API Gateway**: (Planned for future expansion) To manage and route incoming API requests.
- **Load Balancers**: (Planned for future expansion) To distribute traffic across server instances.
- **RDS Database**: An external AWS RDS database for data storage.

## 4. Data Flow

### Interaction Between Tiers
Data flows from the RESTful server to the persistence server, with data processing and storage operations handled efficiently within the AWS infrastructure.

## 5. Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
- **AWS Deployment**: The servers are deployed within the AWS cloud environment for scalability and reliability.
- **Containerization**: Docker is used for containerizing the server components.

### Scalability Considerations
- **Initial Setup**: Designed for minimal scalability in the MVP phase.
- **Future Expansion**: Provisions for integrating load balancers and auto-scaling as part of the full-scale deployment.

## 6. Maintenance and Monitoring

### Routine Maintenance
- Regular updates and maintenance are planned for both server components.

### System Monitoring
- Basic monitoring setup using AWS CloudWatch for tracking server performance.

## 7. Conclusion

This MVP design lays the groundwork for a scalable and robust healthcare data management system, focused on FHIR standards compliance. The architecture is set up within an AWS environment, with considerations for future enhancements and security measures.
