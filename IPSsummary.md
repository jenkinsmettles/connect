# Design Document for `$summary` Operation on Patient Resource

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
This document details the design for implementing the `$summary` operation on the Patient resource, following the International Patient Summary (IPS) implementation guide. It emphasizes synthesizing a patient summary from Explanation of Benefit (EOB) resources and existing patient data.

### Scope
The operation will extract clinical information from EOB resources, specifically focusing on diagnosis codes and the "productOrService" section, to create relevant FHIR resources like MedicationStatement, Procedure, and DeviceOrder.

## 2. Data Sources and Resource Generation

### Explanation of Benefit (EOB) Resources
- **Data Extraction**: Extract clinical data from EOB resources, focusing on diagnosis codes and the "productOrService" section in the items list.
- **Clinical Information Derivation**: Use the extracted data to infer clinical conditions, procedures, medications, and device orders.

### Patient Information
- **Patient Demographics**: Incorporate essential patient demographics into the summary.

## 3. FHIR Resource Synthesis

### Creation of Clinical FHIR Resources
- **MedicationStatement**: Generate these resources based on inferred medication information from EOB data.
- **Procedure**: Derive Procedure resources from the "productOrService" section in EOB items.
- **DeviceOrder**: Create DeviceOrder resources, if applicable, based on the analysis of "productOrService" data in EOB items.

## 4. `$summary` Operation Implementation

### Data Aggregation and Formatting
- **Data Compilation**: Aggregate data from the newly created FHIR resources and existing patient information.
- **IPS Formatting**: Format the summary following the IPS guide, ensuring international applicability and compliance.

## 5. Data Quality and Integrity

### Validation
- **Clinical Data Accuracy**: Validate the accuracy of clinical information derived from EOB resources.
- **FHIR Compliance**: Ensure all created resources are in strict adherence to FHIR standards.

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

### Error Handling
- Implement robust mechanisms for detecting and resolving errors during data synthesis and summary generation.

### Logging
- Maintain detailed logs for the `$summary` operation for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.

## 7. Performance and Scalability

### Efficient Data Processing
- Design the operation to process and compile data efficiently, aiming for minimal response times.

### Scalability
- Ensure the operation can handle varying data volumes and is scalable for future requirements.

## 8. Conclusion

This document outlines a methodical approach for developing the `$summary` operation on the Patient resource. It utilizes available EOB and patient data to generate a comprehensive and compliant patient summary in line with the International Patient Summary guidelines and FHIR standards.
